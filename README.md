# 🎬 Loop

Loop is a social movie discovery app with an **AI search buddy** that helps you find films the way you actually talk about them.  
Instead of digging through lists, you can just chat with Loop like a friend — “Show me Brad Pitt’s movies” or “What’s a good sci-fi thriller from the 90s?” — and it instantly pulls up suggestions.
