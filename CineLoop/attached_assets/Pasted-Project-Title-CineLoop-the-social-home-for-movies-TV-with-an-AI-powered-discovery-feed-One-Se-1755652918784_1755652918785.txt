Project Title

CineLoop — the social home for movies & TV with an AI-powered discovery feed.

One-Sentence Pitch

An Instagram-style mobile app where people post, discuss, and bookmark movies/TV, with a conversational AI that finds what to watch next.

Goals (MVP → V1)

Ship a delightful mobile social feed for titles (posts, likes, comments, lists).

Offer useful discovery on day one (trending + lightweight “Because…” recommendations).

Add a conversational AI search drawer that understands mood, themes, and constraints.

Keep it fast, visual, and safe (clip limits, reporting, basic moderation).

Non-Goals (for MVP)

No streaming-service logins or playback.

No long-form articles, forums, or complex ratings systems.

Web presence limited to a marketing/landing page.

1) User & Use Cases

Primary personas

Casual scroller: wants quick inspiration and fun browsing.

Tastemaker: posts short clips/stills + captions; curates lists; influences friends.

Friend groups: maintain shared watchlists; see each other’s activity.

Explorers: use AI to surface deep-cut recommendations.

Top jobs to be done

“Find me a good movie tonight with minimal effort.”

“Let me share what I watched and see what friends think.”

“Show me fresh but relevant stuff, not the same 30 titles.”

2) Core Features & Scope
A) Social Feed (Instagram-style)

Scrollable cards with poster/clip, title info, rating (optional), short caption, actions (like, comment, repost, save).

Interleaved discovery units: trending titles; occasional “Because you liked…” rec cards.

Infinite scroll, pull-to-refresh, basic notifications (likes, comments, follows).

Done when: a new user can follow others, see a mixed feed, like/comment, repost, and save titles without latency or jank.

B) Posting & Media

Compose flow: pick a title → attach an image or ≤15-second clip → add caption (short), mood tags, optional rating.

Media rules: clips capped by duration and resolution; image size limits; automatic aspect handling.

Reporting control on every post.

Done when: users can publish posts tied to titles; uploads complete with progress; invalid media is gracefully rejected.

C) Titles & Lists

Title pages with poster/backdrop, synopsis, year, runtime, genres, cast highlights, related titles, plus posts about the title.

Personal “Watchlist” and “Favorites.”

Curated lists (public or private) with ordering and sharing.

Done when: users can open a title from any surface, add it to Watchlist/Favorites, and make/edit lists others can view.

D) Search & AI Discovery

Standard search (title/people) with filters (type, year, genre).

AI drawer: free-text queries like “short clever thriller like Prisoners but less bleak,” returning rationale (“Because …”) and 2–3 badges (themes/mood).

Early ranking: relevance, novelty, diversity; explainability badges.

Done when: plain-English queries return sensible results filtered by constraints, with short reasons and badges.

E) Moderation & Safety

Clip/time limits, profanity filter on captions/comments, report flow, rate limits for posting and commenting.

Basic admin queue for reported content; takedown actions.

Done when: harmful or infringing content can be reported and acted on; abuse can’t overwhelm the system.

F) Analytics & Growth (lightweight)

Track core events (feed views, post creation, likes, comments, saves, list actions, search queries).

Invite links and shareable list/title cards (image preview + deep link) later.

Done when: product metrics dashboards show activation, engagement, diversity, and growth signals.

3) Information Architecture (App Navigation)

Home (Feed): mixed stream (friends, trending, recommendations).

Search: title/person search; AI drawer as a bottom sheet.

Create: title picker → media → caption, tags, rating → publish.

Notifications: likes, comments, follows.

Profile: tabs for Posts, Watchlist, Favorites, Lists; edit profile.

Title: details, related, posts about it.

List: viewer/editor for curated sets.

4) Content Model (Conceptual, no code)

User: handle, display name, avatar, bio, privacy setting, counts, timestamps.

Follow: follower and followee references, timestamp.

Title: movie or series; external ID; name; year; poster/backdrop links; structured metadata (genres, people, synopsis).

Post: author, attached title, media reference (image or clip), caption, optional rating, mood tags, counters (likes, comments), timestamps, moderation status.

Interaction: like or comment on a post, with timestamps and minimal body for comments.

List: owner, name, description, visibility, ordered items (title references).

User Collections: watchlist, favorites (each is a set of title references).

Event (analytics): event type, who, what, context, timestamp (append-only).

5) User Flows (Step-by-Step)

Onboarding

Sign up (email or social).

Choose handle, set avatar/bio (optional).

Follow suggestions (featured tastemakers + phone contacts if permitted).

Land on feed with seeded trending content.

Create a Post

Tap create.

Pick a title (search modal).

Add poster/still or ≤15s clip; auto-fit aspect; preview.

Add caption (short), mood tags, optional rating.

Publish → success toast → inserted into followers’ feeds.

Engage in Feed

Scroll; like/comment/repost/save inline.

Tap title to open details or list to open collection.

Encounter periodic “Because…” rec cards; tap to view details or save.

Search & AI

Search by name/person; refine with filters.

Open AI drawer; type natural language; view ranked results with badges and short reason.

Save items to Watchlist/Favorites.

Lists

Create list; add titles; reorder.

Toggle public/private; share via link or shareable image later.

6) Recommendation & Search Logic (Conceptual)

Inputs

Title metadata (name, year, genres, synopsis, cast/crew).

User tastes (implicit: likes, saves, dwell; explicit: favorites, lists).

Social proximity (friend engagement), limited to avoid echo chambers.

Candidate retrieval

Keyword and person match for explicit queries.

Semantic similarity on themes and moods (later via embeddings; MVP can use tags and heuristics).

Related titles (by cast/crew/genre/era).

Scoring

Match to query or user profile.

Novelty boost (down-weight very recently seen or saved).

Quality proxy (community engagement; simple for MVP).

Diversity via slate assembly to avoid same-lane saturation.

Explainability

Short “Because…” reason with two or three badges (e.g., “witty banter,” “ensemble,” “’90s vibe”).

Surfaces

AI drawer results; occasional feed cards; title page “Related for you.”

7) UX & Visual Standards

Aesthetic: cinematic, dark mode first, poster-forward.

Feed cards: large media, minimal chrome, clear actions; consistent spacing.

Typography: bold title, subdued meta, compact caption.

Motion: subtle transitions; instant tap feedback.

Accessibility: high contrast, scalable text, gesture alternatives.

8) Performance Targets

Cold start to first feed paint: ~1–2 seconds on mid-range devices.

60 fps scrolling on feed with dozens of cards.

Media uploads produce visible progress within one second.

Search results appear within ~400–700 ms after query submission (excluding first network warm-up).

9) Safety, Privacy, and Policy

Clips: ≤15 seconds, capped resolution; automatic rejection over limits.

Reporting: available on every card and comment; simple reason selection.

Moderation: flagged items enter a review queue; actions include remove, warn, suspend.

Rate limits: posting, commenting, and follows per minute/day to prevent spam.

Privacy: optional private accounts; per-post visibility can be phase-two.

Data controls: delete account and content from profile settings.

10) Telemetry & KPIs

Activation: time to first follow; time to first post; % of new users who create or save a list within 48 hours.
Engagement: DAU/WAU; average session length; feed scroll depth; save-to-watchlist rate; comments per post.
Discovery quality: unique titles surfaced per user per week; share of long-tail titles; rec-card click-through.
Safety: report rate; moderation resolution time; repeat offender rate.
Growth: invites sent/accepted; shared links opened; creator retention.

12) Acceptance Criteria (MVP Definition of Done)

A first-time user can sign up, follow at least three suggested accounts, and immediately see an engaging feed combining friend posts and discovery items.

The user can create a post tied to a title with an image or short clip, add a caption and tags, and publish successfully.

The user can like, comment, repost, and save titles; saved items appear in Watchlist or a chosen List.

The user can open a title page, see key info and posts, and add the title to Watchlist/Favorites.

The user can use standard search to find titles and the AI drawer to find recommendations by mood/theme with short “Because…” reasons.

The app remains smooth (no stutters), first paint is fast, and uploads show clear progress.

Reporting and basic moderation processes function; abusive behavior is limited by rate controls.

Analytics capture the core funnel and engagement events necessary for iteration.

13) Risks & Mitigations

Copyright on clips: Strict clip limits and reporting tools; encourage posters/trailers and original commentary.

Cold start feeds: Seed trending titles and curated lists; follow suggestions on onboarding.

Filter bubbles: Enforce novelty/diversity; provide “see less like this” control later.

Abuse/spam: Rate limits, profanity filter, quick moderation queue.

Performance regressions: Continuous profiling on low-mid devices; image/video optimization strategy.

14) Hand-Off Checklist for Riplit

Confirm stack choices and hosting; agree on environment variable plan and secrets storage.

Confirm title metadata source and field mapping (names, IDs, genres, people, images).

Lock design system tokens and component specs; finalize high-fidelity flows for all primary screens.

Review sprint plan and acceptance criteria; assign owners; set demo dates per sprint.

Establish moderation playbook and response SLAs before beta.

Define analytics events and dashboards; validate instrumentation during Sprint 5.
